This is a project I started to ease the management of our Cub Scout Pack's Pinewood Derby event.  It was written in my spare time - between work, work on my masters, running the kids to and fro to all of their activities and running the rest of the Cub Scout Tiger Den program.  

Needless to say, it's a work in progress.  

It worked well at our event on 2/27/2016 but some of the code is very quick and dirty and there are a lot of improvements I'm planning to make before next year's event.
